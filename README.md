# Login_mail
Sending a mail to the owner of the laptop when it is opened. 
To send a mail we use the SMTP library in python.
To run the program when the laptop is switched on, we have to create a batch file and specify the path of our python program in it. 
Now add the batch file to the startup programs (program that run when the system is switched on).
